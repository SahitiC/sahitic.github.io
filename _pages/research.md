## A decision theoretic taxonomy of pacing, delay and procrastination

We model various (sub-) optimal policies for decisions to delay across tasks with different structures using principles of reinforcment learning and decison making. We integrate these in a common, systematic taxonomy of pacing and procrastination. We show preliminary evidence for the plausibility of our taxonomy using real-world student data.

## Acetylcholine and optimal control of attention 

In this project, we modelled paying attention in a sustained attention task as an internal action with costs and benefits. We analysed the optimal control of attention as a partially observable markov decision process (POMDP) and provided qualitative evidence that phasic Acetlycholine signals facilitate the internal action of optional attention.
