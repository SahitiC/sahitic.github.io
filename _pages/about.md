I am a Graduate student at the IMPRS-MMFD at the Graduate Training Center for Neuroscience in Tuebingen, Germany. I am interested in understanding various cognitive and systems phenomena in Neuroscience using computational modelling and machine learning. I did my Bachelors and Masters in Science at IISER Pune.
Apart from science, I am an avid reader and a dancer. I also care deeply about keeping our world inhabitable and making it work for everyone.
