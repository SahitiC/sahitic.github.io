I am a PhD student with Peter Dayan at the Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics. Prior to this, I completed my Masters in Computational Neurosicence at the University of T\"ubingen and BS-MS at IISER Pune in India. I am interested in understanding various cognitive and systems phenomena in neuroscience using computational modelling and machine learning. I am currently working on understanding the mechanisms that underly people's decisions to delay and in the exterme cases, procrastinate. In my masters, together with Kevin Lloyd and Peter Dayan, I modeled optimal decisions pay attention to a stimulus in a signal detection task in rats, and relating them to patterns of phasic acetylcholine activity. Apart from science, I am an avid reader and a dancer. I also care deeply about keeping our world inhabitable and making it work for everyone.
