I am a Graduate student at the IMPRS-MMFD at the Graduate Training Center for Neuroscience in Tuebingen, Germany. I am interested in understanding various cognitive and systems phenomena in Neuroscience using computational modelling and machine learning. I did my Bachelors and Masters in Science at IISER Pune. I continue to be in wonder of the mind and the universe and seek new perspectives.  
Apart from science, I am an avid reader and an eager dancer. I also happen to care about stopping humanity's march into making our home un-inhabitable.
